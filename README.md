An agent built for the purpose of Instagram/youtube/other social media analyzer from scraped json input and produces json output with appended analysis key in nested json consisting of question and answers to the original one .
To produce new output first delete older output.json from the directory , and to run app.py run it like: python app.py <json file path>


This agent will be used in a data pipeline for an ambitious project which cannot be disclosed.
